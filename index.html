It was produced in conjuction with the Lego Ninjago line of construction toys, based on the shows characters and plot. The story is set in the fictional realm of ninjago, a place with hints of East Asian mythology and culture, telling the story of six young ninjas and their conflicts with the forces of evil, who are also described as &rsquo;&rsquo;Elemental Masters&rsquo;&rsquo;, various characters who have elemental powers.</p>

He is the second son of the first spinjitzu master, Garmadon's younger brother, and Lloyd&rsquo;s uncle. Technically, creation is not an element, it&rsquo;s an elemental essence made up of the four main elements, fire, earth, lightning and ice. He very frequently wields his father&rsquo;s staff, although he is brefily seen wielding a katana and a shéng biāo(or rope dart). The only showcase of his elemental power in the series is him sommoning his elemental dragon. He is very cautious with his power since he knows it&rsquo;s very powerful shouldn&rsquo;t be overused. Wu grew up learning the art of the ninja alongside his brother, often using his countless years of experience to guide the ninja in their many battles, mostly in the form of riddles or very cryptic phrases. Because of Wu&rsquo;s Oni blood, he has lived for more than a thousand years.</p>

He is the first son of the first spinjitzu master, Wu&rsquo;s older brother, Misako&rsquo;s estranged husband and Lloyd&rsquo;s father. Like creation, destruction is not an element, it&rsquo;s an elemental essence Garmadon inherited from his father and his Oni heritage. Thanks to Lloyd, Garmadon becomes clensed of evil in season 2 and temporarly replaces Wu as a mentor to the ninja in seasons 3-4. After sacrificing himself to the cursed realm in season 4, he is later reanimated as a being of pure evil in season 8, by the antagonist group, the Sons of Garmadon. Like Wu, his Oni heritage has allowed him to live for over a thousand years.</p>
