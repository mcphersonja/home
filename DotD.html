		<p>Day of the departed is a Halloween special for the animated TV series, &rsquo;&rsquo;Lego Ninjago&rsquo;&rsquo;. It was released on October 29, 2016, coinciding with Halloween and takes place between season 6 and 7. The special takes place on the Day of the Departed, a day where people honour the memories of their deceased loved ones. The story is focused on the black ninja, Cole, who becomes worried about fading away in his ghost form while fighting the main antagonist of the special, Sensei Yang. While Cole is battling Yang in Yang&rsquo;s temple, the other ninja must battle the spirits of old enemies that he has accidentally released from the Departed Realm. The spirits each possess their own mannequins from the Ninjago History Museum, which brings them to life. After a massive battle, Cole goes through the Rift of Return created by the Yin Blade, which allows him to become human one again. The ninja celebrate the return of Cole and decide to use Yang&rsquo;s temple and their new base.</p>
